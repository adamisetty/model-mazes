  - [ ] Need to drop multiple small balls from top of screen
  - [ ] Give user the ability to draw edges themselves
  - [ ] Need to create edges that the balls will bounce off

- **4/18/20**
  - Figures out how cinder coordinates line up with box2d coordinates
  - Creates circle body, as main player of game

- **4/21/20**
  - Having issues with dynamic object colliding with static object
  - Small ball presumes to have force in an unknown direction
  - Needs to complete the following:
  - [ ] Create box around Cinder screen, as a boundary

  - [ ] Give user the ability to draw edges themselves
  - [ ] Need to create edges that the balls will bounce off

**4/25/20**
  - Takes position of user mouse to draw lines
  - The final line that the user draws is not displayed

**4/26/20**

  - Balls still do not collide properly with the drawn edges
  - Balls now correctly collide with the ground fixture

  - [ ] Fixes an end target for balls to hit, to determine if player has won 

**4/28/20** 
  - Ball now collides correctly with right and left walls

  - [x] Create box around Cinder screen, as a boundry
  
 
**5/1/20**
   - Creates edge objects from user input
   - Decides to use Polygon body and rotate rather than edge body
   - Need to complete the following:
