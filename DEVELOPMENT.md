# Development

---
Currently, my game, Falling Fun, works to create a set number of small balls. These small balls drop to the ground with the force of gravity, and bounce against eachother if they interact with eachother. 
I create a central engine class which communicates with my_app.cc (which contains the cinder aspect). The engine class connects with a class containing the small balls and a class containing the solid edges, which is just the ground right now.
